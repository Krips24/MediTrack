    system that allows patients to store, manage, and share their medical
    records securely. The system is designed to provide patients with a secure
    and user-friendly platform to maintain their medical history, including

    access their records anytime, anywhere, and can share them with healthcare
    providers, family members, or caregivers. Meditrack also enables patients to
    track their medication adherence, monitor chronic conditions, and receive
    important reminders and alerts to help them stay on top of their health. The
    system integrates with wearable devices and health trackers, allowing
    patients to track their fitness goals and monitor their progress over time.
    Meditrack uses state-of-the-art encryption methods to protect patients' data
    and guarantees that their information will never be shared without their
    consent. By joining the Meditrack community, patients can take control of
    their healthcare journey, manage their medical records, and communicate
